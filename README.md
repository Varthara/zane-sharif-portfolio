# UW-Challenge-2-Portfolio-Site
<!-- This site is developed as an ongoing effort to document web develop projects completed by Zane Sharif. Currently, three hypothetical projects are displayed. They are "the Doomsday Clock", "Valheim Server Management", and "Renewable Energy Modeling." These images function as hyperlinks, but since the projects are hypothetical, they do not lead to an actual result.

Contact information in the nav bar is functional.
